# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 

# In[6]:


2+9


# # This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
# 

# In[7]:


result = (3 * 4) + 5
result


# # This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
# 
# 

# In[9]:


hours = 200 / 60
hours


# **Objectives:**
# 

# - List popular languages for Data Science.
# - List popular libraries for Data Science.
# - List tools used in Data Science.
# - Demonstrate arithmetic operations in Python.
